# Dotfiles, git, tmux (5min)
- install git, tmux

```
sudo apt-get install tmux git
```

- install vim config (what about vim itself?) from https://github.com/prendradjaja/vim-config
- install dotfiles from https://github.com/prendradjaja/dotfiles
    - disable alt key in ubuntu:
        - i think old ubuntu (i used 12.04? on personal laptop and vaguely recall) had this as a terminal setting
        - but new (16.04 at Everlaw) has this as a Unity setting
            - this can be fixed via Keyboard settings > Shortcuts > Launchers > Key to show the HUD
- switch ctrl and caps
    - ubuntu 13.10+: install gnome-tweak-tool and go to Typing
